## ~Definitions~
### Linked list
_Linked lists are inserted by knowing the previous node.
    Linked lists are a linear sequence meaning it has to run from beginning to end
    in order to insert, delete, or modify a node. If we want to insert, delete, or modify from the middle
    you have to run through and know where the previous node to where you want to edit
    is and do it_
    
- insert: adds to beginning of list
- delete: delets element at beginning of list
- deleteAt: removes element using key
- size: return number of elements in the list
- isEmpty: returns true if list is empty, otherwise returns false
- search: searches element using key
- display: displays complete list

### Stack (LIFO data structure)
- push: insert element at one end of stack called top
- pop: remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if its nonempty
- peek: return the element at the top of the stack without removing
- size: return the number of elements in stack
- isEmpty: return true if stack is empty, otherwise false

### Queue (FIFO, opposite of a stack)
- enqueue: insert an element at the end of queue
- dequeue: removes first element of queue if not emtpy
- peek: retusns the element of queue without removing if the queue isnt empty
- size: return the number of elements in Queue
- isEmpty: returns true if queue is empty, otherwise false

### BinaryTree
- insert(): insert a new node into tree in correct place
- delete: delete a node in tree
- search: search a node in tree
- size(): count number of nodes in tree
- preorder traverse, postorder traverse, inorder traverse
